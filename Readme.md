# Readme

A platform to help our friends to escape some walls.

## Functions

The whole platform is more likely to be a front-end wrapping the ShadowsocksR manyuser in mudb.json.

What we are providing is an authentication system corresponding to each individual shadowsocks account, and a RESTful API manipulating those info. (See documentation of APIs).

Currently, we are using Vue.js to build the front-end and embedded it into a page of hexo (See `front-end/deploy`).

At the same time, we are using Flask and Mongodb to maintain the back-end and the authentication.
