## Gonna Do

* ~~Install ss-panel ([link](https://sspanel.xyz/docs/install/manual)) **Not working properly due to configuration of PHP** **May be dropped**~~

* ~~Optimizing Shadowsocks ([link](http://www.jianshu.com/p/17522251883e))~~

    * Note: we are not going to completely follow this one, since there's a better way to do tcp congestion control (bbr) which has already been installed.


* **[Working on front-end currently]** Build front-end & back-end base on Vue(js) & Flask(python) 

* Add other protocals to the server since SS might not be available in the future. (It's more likely to be a dream currently)

### Added Jul 11 late nignt

* ~~Develope interfaces for ShadowsocksR many users, and maybe a front-end for later work.~~

    * ~~ Note: as the version of many users we have used so far is based on mudbjson, the coordination with a **real** database may be concerned as a hidden problem. ~~

* ~~Start to operate the service~~

### Added Jul 13

* Get a 404 and 50x page (Path: /usr/share/nginx/html)

* ~~Get a favicon~~

### Added Jun 23

* ~~Implement the controller~~

* ~~Start the implementation of front-end~~

### Added Aug 4

* Feature: click a button to show the shadowsocksr password

* Feature: add tips for views. (Ref: el-tooltips in Elements)
